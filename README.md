- Setup a [Discord App](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/create) & create a Bot user - save the TOKEN it gives you
- Clone the repo 'git clone https://github.com/AdenForshaw/theDogAPI-discord-bot'
- Change 'DOG_API_KEY' and 'DISCORD_TOKEN' in the 'index.js' file for the values you from above.
- Run 'npm install' in the cloned folder to install the libraries
- Run 'node index.js' to start the application
- In the Discord channel you added the Bot send the message 'woof'
- Enjoy the Dog image!
